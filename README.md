# Test Inrupt Java Client

This project was created to test the new Inrupt Java client libraries by providing
a simple application answering to these requirements

```text
You are building the next-generation digital book library based on Solid. You can think about some similar services such as Goodreads and
Audible personalized to your experience. To start you must implement a prototype first, a command-line interface application that only works for
your user

The following User Stories (US) will help:
US1: As a digital book library owner I want to be able to authenticate to my digital book library available on my Pod.
US2: As a digital book library owner I want to be able to add a book to my digital book library on my Pod.
US3: As a digital book library owner I want to be able to edit the description of a book from my digital library on my Pod.
US4: As a digital book library owner I want to be able to delete a book from my digital library on my Pod.
US5: As a digital book library owner I want to be able to read the details of a digital book.

A friend of yours has a list of really cool books. It is a collection of books compiled by all her closest friends. She gives you access to that list in
the form of an access grant and link to the resource.
US6: As a digital book library owner I want to read the book list my friend shared with me and gave me access to.
US7: As a digital book library owner I want to write to my friendâ€™s book list, she gave me write access to, an additional book title.
